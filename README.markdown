# HTML5 Demos and Examples

A collection of HTML5 experiments I've created, now open source and on GitHub, so please go ahead and help me hack this resource in to a wealth of demos that other authors can learn from.

## Aim

* If a user can hit view source on the demo, then we've done our job
* Where possible browser support should be named (FF3.5, etc)
* All content is open source and content is [Creative Commons Share Alike 2.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/uk/)
* Individual demos, if authored by someone other than [@rem](http://twitter.com) can be credited as appropriate

## Demos Required

* Microdata
* SVG
* More audio and video demos
* More introductions to canvas
* More event based stuff
* WebSockets (@rem - have a demo ready, but not the server side)

## TODO

* Clearer versioning on the demos, rather than "All bar Opera", should include last version to support feature, i.e. Opera 10.10b, Chrome 4 dev, Safari 4.0, etc.
* Reorganise the directory structure to categorise demos
* Create an easy way to drive the template for the site (currently it's a complete copy for each of the files)
