# HTML5 Demos and Examples

A collection of HTML5 experiments I've created, now open source and on GitHub, so please go ahead and help me hack this resource in to a wealth of demos that other authors can learn from.

## Aim

* If a user can hit view source on the demo, then we've done our job
* Where possible browser support should be named (FF3.5, etc)
* All content is open source and content is [Creative Commons Share Alike 2.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/uk/)
* Individual demos, if authored by someone other than [@rem](http://twitter.com) can be credited as appropriate
