/*
  Note that this example used to contain the video inline in the HTML above.
  However, since it's been understood that there's the possible risk of a race
  condition (which I'll explain in a moment), it means the best way to prevent
  this problem is to generate the video element attaching the events, and only
  once all this is in place, assign the source and insert the element.
  
  Other possible alternatives would be to listen on the window object for the 
  loadedmetadata event and to check the event.target with the element we're 
  interested in, but it would require the script at the top of the code - 
  which would block, and that's something I prefer not to do.
  
  Another alternative is to put inline event handlers in the markup, again
  this is something I prefer not to do. 
  
  I was called out by a couple of eager folk, one suggesting that what we had
  before wasn't The Right Way(tm) - which frankly, ultimately, since we can't
  attach the event handlers like we would anything else (though technically
  an image element is subject to the same problems), I argue that there's 
  therefore No Right Way(tm) to achieve this.  Anyway, this change is for 
  them. I know they'll love me a little more for it. Maybe. Perhaps. ...
